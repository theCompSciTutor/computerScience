Mark the start node as a distance of 0 from itself and
all other nodes as an infinite distance from the start
node.
WHILE the destination node is unvisited
    Go to the closest unvisited node to A (initially this
    will be A itself) and call this the current node.
    FOR every unvisited node connected to the current node:
        Calculate the distance to the current plus the
        distance of the edge to unvisited
        If this distance is less than the currently
        recorded shortest distance, make it the new
        shortest distance.
    NEXT connected node
    Mark the current node as visited.
